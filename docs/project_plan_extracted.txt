AI ChatBotUCSI INTERNSHIP PROGRAM


AI ChatBotUCSI INTERNSHIP PROGRAM1. PROJECT OVERVIEW This project aims to develop aPython-based AI Chatbot systemwithintwo weeks (40 total hours)to supporting queries ranging from admission, programmes, and faculty information to academic records, results, and campus life services.본프로젝트는2주(총40시간)내에Python 기반AI 챗봇시스템을개발하여, 입학, 학과및학부정보부터학적, 성적, 그리고캠퍼스생활관련서비스에이르기까지다양한문의를지원하는것을목표로합니다.


AI ChatBotUCSI INTERNSHIP PROGRAMThis project emphasizes:  1.Short development cycle (2 weeks/40 hours)  2.Team-based competition (2 parallel teams)  3.Integration with UCSI Database4.An AI system with basic self-learning and continuous improvement capability이프로젝트는다음사항을강조합니다:1.짧은개발주기(2주/40시간)2.팀기반경쟁(2개의병렬팀)3.UCSI 데이터베이스와의통합4.기본적인자기학습및지속적개선능력을갖춘AI 시스템1.
